📊 Exciting News: My First SQL Data Cleaning Project using MySQL 🛍️


🔍 **Project Overview**: For this project, I worked with a Housing Dataset. This Project I complete with the help of @Alex  🛒
 **Dataset Highlights**: The dataset included customer profiles, purchase history, product details, and more. With the power of SQL, I was able to navigate and manipulate this data to extract valuable insights.

💡 ** What I do for clean data set using MySQL
1.  change data type text to date
2.  populate property address data
3.  breaking down address into individual columns (address, city, state)
4.  change Y and N to Yes and No 
5.  remove duplicate
6.  delete unused column
